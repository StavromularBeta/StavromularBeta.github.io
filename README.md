### [Rover Resources](https://github.com/StavromularBeta/RoverResources)
#### Python, SQL 
##### Tkinter, SQLite3, pandas, numpy, xlsxwriter, openpyxl 

software that tracks the ordering and inventory of standards, media, office supplies, general equipment, chemicals, lab-ware, and any other required items for an analytical chemistry laboratory.

Items received by the lab are ordered by individuals, confirmed by administrators from a shared shopping cart, and are tracked from request to reception. Individual inventory items contain a trail of information that accompanies their lifetime in the laboratory.

### [Rover Reporting](https://github.com/StavromularBeta/RoverReporting/tree/master)
#### Python, SQL, Latex
##### Tkinter, SQLite3, pandas, numpy, xlsxwriter, openpyxl

Create Analytical Chemistry reports by analytes. Allows for data import from .csv files based on sample numbers from many batches. Alternatively, create reports by batch for multiple analytes. Matches client metadata to analytical data to produce finished reports. This software was made for MB Laboratories Ltd.

Software allowed for increased throughput of samples in the laboratory. Examples of reports produced by software in a real world setting can be found at the following link - [the RoverReporting generated results are the potency, pesticides, and toxin results.](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/public-safety-and-emergency-services/public-safety/cannabis/mblabs-results.pdf)

### [Cannabase](https://github.com/StavromularBeta/Cannabase)
#### Python, SQL
##### Tkinter, SQLite3, pandas, numpy, win32api

Sample tracking database API built to handle incoming samples for testing as per Health Canada's requirements on legal cannabis products. Contains spaces for notes, sample photos, client information, and testing status updates. Basic reports generated by RoverReporting can be displayed on individual sample pages.
